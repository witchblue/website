# The Most Accurate Movies and Tv Shows on Hacking
![movies-thumbnail](/movies.png "üßëüèª‚Äçüíª")

Compared to reading books, people tend to learn things more quickly via visuals. Thus, watching films can help you quickly imagine what's happening. Through the hacking movies, one might simply imagine how hackers think, make decisions, and plan. 

Onscreen movies set up an atmosphere about a hacker, who is an antisocial individual in a black hoodie typing something on the system or just hacking someone with a single click. However, a hacker is actually someone who is knowledgeable about operating systems, programming languages, computer networks, uncovering vulnerabilities, writing lines of code, and more.

As I watched them, the following films struck me as being more accurate and realistic:

## Mr.Robot

`Synopsis` : Elliot, a cyber-security engineer suffering from anxiety, works for a corporation and hacks felons by night. Panic strikes him after Mr Robot, a cryptic anarchist, recruits him to ruin his company.

`Genre` : Drama, Techno-thriller, Psychological thriller

`Director` : Sam Esmail

`Year` : 2015-2019

`Seasons` : 4

`Watched` : 2022

`My Review` : The movie is highly technical as there was a team of cyber security professionals behind the scenes to assist, and it contains a few stereotypes like the main character wears all black and is anti-social, but it is still the most accurate and realistic over other movies.

{{< admonition warning "Spoiler" false >}}
Elliot has Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID).

I'll keep you updated as soon as I find a movie that fits this genre...Happy movie time people.
