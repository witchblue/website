## Keyboard Shortcuts

The keyboard shortcuts listed below will assist you in writing scripts or running commands and, in addition to that, they will help you save time:

- ctrl+ alt + t :  to open the terminal
- windows + arrows : to move the location of the window
- ctrl + shift + plus key :  increase the font size
- ctrl + shift + minus key :  decrease the font size
- ctrl + l : to clear the terminal
- ctrl + c : to end a process 
- ctrl + z : to pause the process
- up arrow , down arrow : to navigate through previously used commands 
- tab key : to auto complete the command typed 
- ctrl + shift + w : to close the terminal


And in the upcoming parts of this series, I'll be adding additional shortcuts to the list as I discover them.
